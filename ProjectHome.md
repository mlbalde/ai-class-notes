In Fall 2011, Stanford Engineering offered the class "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" taught by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig for free on the web:

The purpose of this project is to typeset the notes for this class using the LaTeX typesetting language. The goal is to create notes that are
- comprehensive,
- understandable,
- thorough, and
- attractive.

In general, the notes should only contain what the professors presented; however, it is admissible to add a few details to points that may not be entirely clear or well-explained. It would be desirable, but not necessary, to include the quizzes, and even the homework and exams, as part of the notes.
